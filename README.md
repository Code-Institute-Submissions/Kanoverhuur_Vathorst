# Kanoverhuur_Vathorst

Kanoverhuur_Vathorst (= a canoe rental agency in the city of Amersfoort, The Netherlands) is a website enabling existing and prospective inhabitants of the Amersfoort Vathorst area to inform themselves of the possibilities to rent one or more canoes to explore the urban and nature area in and surrounding their home area. The site aims to inform prospective and existing clients on the type of recreational canoes (single person, two-person, Canadian family canoe), possible routes to take, pricing per day/hour/canoe, equipment and accessories for rent, general conditions and cancellation, payment options and packages for larger family outings or birthday parties, as well as location, parking information and opening hours.

With this product, Kanoverhuur Vathorst aims to attract more clients and increase its return on investment on the canoes for the year 2020 and beyond.

This is primarily a B2C application, although companies occasionally may reach out for a company outing (B2B). For that a separate section/page is envisaged for future releases with tailor made content.
The footer will show the links to socials (not present yet).

In future releases, an API to Google maps will be included, as well as the possibility to make online reservations based on the availability of canoes per day or part of the day. We also foresee an API to a weather forecast to be featured on the homepage.
We will also add a section to feature reviews and possibly a gallery, although we may wish to just simply provide a link to our socials for photos and videos. 
We also foresee an instructional max-3-minute video for people to watch prior to arriving at Kanoverhuur Vathorst, enabling them to take knowledge of safe and paddling.

Kanoverhuur Vathorst is a second activity of Lakeside SUP, a stand-up paddle board school and SUP-rental company in the same Vathorst area. Kanoverhuur Vathorst will use its own name and branding, however chooses to use colors that are close to or will match the colors of Lakeside SUP (see https://lakesidesup.nl) for consistency and brand recognition.

The site will be featured in Dutch as well as English, for both the sake of enabling Code Institute readers to understand the content as well as targeting part of the international clientele in the Vathorst area.

## UX
 
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

Strategy Plan:
Target audience:
Mobile savvy public, mostly on smart phone. They want to be able to quickly see whether 
a) canoes are available
b) what the pricing is
c) what the location is and
d) they want a fast, simple and convenient way to book and pay ahead (for themselves or for their kids).
e) get a feel that this is a trustworthy company. From LakesideSUP clients, we have heard that a professional website helps to attract clients from outside the region and even from abroad. 

Kanoverhuur Vathorst wants to:
a) inform a broader public of its existence and thus attract more customers to increase the return on investment of the canoes
b) have an application that enables customers to book ahead online, so that manual processing of booking can be decreased as much as possible, as well as reduce the number of faults/mistakes when handling bookings by phone or through e-mails.

Target group
-	Parents (usually 30+ of age) with children between age 5 -16 years looking to spend some time on the waters of Vathorst, Amersfoort (family outing)
-	Parents that wish to celebrate their sons/daugther’s birthday party on the water
-	Adults in the age of 18-65 (with an emphasis between 25 and 55) looking to spend time individually with their partner/friend and enjoy architecture/nature
-	This target group is mostly living in Amersfoort, with an emphasis on the Vathorst area and its surrounding neighbourhoods.
-	Very mobile savvy, highly educated, well paid jobs generally.  Mobile-first approach required, ipad/tablets second most important, desktop third.


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Desired Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

-	The top left corner will house the logo and the hyperlink to the homepage.
-   The top right corner of the page will house the navigation bar (on a mobile represented by the 'hamburger' icon). This will include "Home", "Our canoes", "Canoe routes", "Pricing", "Reservations", "About us" and a "Contact" link.
-   A hero image of a canoe on the water, with the canoe on the left. 
-   On top of the hero image a jumbotron with a welcome message and a "Reservations" button for returning clients.
-   The center part of the homepage will house three clickable images (round shaped), next to each other on tablet and screen and below each other on a mobile, with two sencentes each for the respective topics "Our canoes", "Canoe trips/routes" and "Pricing". Each of the images will be clickable to their respective pages and get an effect (to be determined).
-   Below the center there will be a "reservations" button, leading to a modal with keys such as name, reservation data, canoe type (dropdown), number of canoes, phone and e-mail address. Once submitted, the resulting page will mention that we will be in touch soon.
-   Lastly a footer section, containing on the left side the (visiting) address, contact details, opening hours, a link to a download with general conditions including a cancellation policy. The right side of the footer will contain links to four socials i.e. Youtube, Pinterest, Facebook and Instagram.
-   The "Our canoes" page will provide a description and a picture of each type of recreational canoe available (single person, two-person, Canadian family canoe).
-	The "Canoe routes" will provide 3 suggested/possible routes to take including time needed to finish. Perhaps a clickable map?
-	The "Pricing" page will generate an overview of pricing per day/hour/canoe, equipment and accessories for rent, payment options, and a download to the applicable general conditions. And feature the same reservation button as the home page.
-	address, parking information and opening hours.
-	A footer with links to socials, where videos and additional photos will be posted. These will be facebook, pinterest, Youtube/Vimeo, Instagram. LinkedIn and Twitter will not be used.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
-	A home page section similar to "Our canoes" offering packages for larger family outings or birthday parties, including pricing.
-   a company outing section/page for B2B clients. For that a separate section/page is envisaged for future releases with tailor made content and information form.
-	an API to Google maps will be included enabling the customer to navigate to the destination
-	a possibility to make online reservations based on the availability of canoes per day or part of the day and pay for them immediately. The summer days may cause canoes to be fully rented out well in advance; by paying and reserving in advance they will be secure of their outing.
-	an API to a weather forecast to be featured on the homepage, enabling clients to pick the right date with suitable weather conditions.
-	A reviews section, enabling prospective clients to get a feeling of trustworthiness of our location.
-	an instructional max-3-minute video for clients to watch prior to arriving at Kanoverhuur Vathorst, enabling them to take knowledge of safe and fun paddling. The video will be hosted on Youtube or Vimeo. The purpose of the video is
    to give parents the feeling that we're taking security of their children and themselves very seriously. Following the instructions will also contribute to the fun on the water and prevent injuries.
-   an instructional video on how to pass any sluice or canoe crossing


## Technologies Used
For this application, HTML5 and CSS3 were used. Additionally, to ensure a flawless mobile experience, Bootstrap4 (https://getbootstrap.com) has been used. 
Fonts have been obtained from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com) and icons have been rendered from Fontawesome (https://www.fontawesome.com)

[check this part before submitting, if you have used other tools from other sources CDNJS for example, don’t forget to put that here!!]

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
