# Introduction

Kanoverhuur Vathorst is a canoe rental agency in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, located in the Vathorst district. The district has gained status for its 
architectural beauty, its central and convenient location, its closeness to the Arkemheen Polder and the abundance of water. The Vathorst district is popular with families and is
highly attractive to families moving from Amsterdam and Utrecht. Kanoverhuur Vathorst is the third company in the district offering recreational rental vehicles on the water, alongside
Sloepverhuur Vathorst (electric dinghys) and Lakeside SUP (stand up paddle board school and rental). Kanoverhuur Vathorst is a second activity of the latter.  

This website aims to inform inhabitants of the Vathorst district of: 
- possibilities to rent kayaks and canoes and accessories 
- possible routes and architecture to enjoy
- pricing per day/hour/canoe
- the general conditions and cancellation policy
- payment options
- packages for family outings or birthday parties
- instructions for safe and comfortable canoeing
- as well as location, parking information and opening hours.

Commercially, Kanoverhuur Vathorst aims to
- increase brand awareness
- attract more clients
- simplify booking through its reservation form
- and increase its return on investment on the canoes for the year 2020 and beyond.

This is primarily a B2C application, although companies occasionally may reach out for a company outing (B2B). For that a separate section/page is envisaged for future releases with tailor made content.
The footer will show the links to socials (not active yet).

Although being a second activity of Lakeside SUP, Kanoverhuur Vathorst will use its own name and branding and chooses to use colors that are different to the colors of Lakeside SUP.

The site targets mainly Dutch-speaking clients, but is made in English, enabling Code Institute readers to understand the content. The final live version will be in Dutch only.

## UX
 
The Vathorst district has 26,441 inhabitants (2019, source: City of Amersfoort), of which 79% is in the age bracket of 5-54 years. 26% of total inhabitants is between 5 and 19 years old. The total number
of households is 2,627, of which almost 1,000 are families with one or more children. 75% of the inhabitants are in the higher income groups. The target audience is a highly mobile savvy public.  
The city of Amersfoort has developed the Vathorst area with active use of the water in mind. Especially in the Laak area, where houses have been built with 12 hectares of available water in the canals and the
surrounding area. Kanoverhuur Vathorst is located in the Laak area and offers easy access to the canals and the surrounding nature. 

The customer will want to quickly: 
a) understand which types of canoes are available
b) what the pricing is
c) what the location is and
d) involve a fast, simple and convenient way to book and pay ahead (for themselves or for their kids).
e) get a feel that this is a trustworthy company. From LakesideSUP clients, we have heard that a professional website helps to attract clients from outside the region and even from abroad. 

Kanoverhuur Vathorst wants to:
a) inform a broader public of its existence and thus attract more customers to increase the return on investment of the canoes
b) have an application that enables customers to book ahead online, so that manual processing of booking can be decreased as much as possible, as well as reduce the number of faults/mistakes when handling bookings by phone or through e-mails.

Target group
-	Parents (usually 30+ of age) with children between age 5 -16 years looking to spend some time on the waters of Vathorst, Amersfoort (family outing)
-	Parents that wish to celebrate their sons/daugtherâ€™s birthday party on the water
-	Adults in the age of 18-65 (with an emphasis between 25 and 55) looking to spend time individually or with their partner/friends and enjoy architecture/nature
-	This target group is mostly living in Amersfoort, with an emphasis on the Vathorst area and its surrounding neighbourhoods.
-	Very mobile savvy, highly educated, well paid jobs generally. Mobile-first approach required, ipad/tablets second most important, desktop third.

### Features Left to Implement
-	A home page section similar to "Our canoes" offering packages for larger family outings or birthday parties, including pricing.
-   A page detailing the additional gear to rent, such as safety vests, containers, etc. 
-   A page detailing payment options: this will be included once the booking can be made automatically and paid for immediately.
-   A company outing section/page for B2B clients. For that a separate section/page is envisaged for future releases with tailor made content and information form.
-	An API to Google maps will be included enabling the customer to navigate to the destination
-	A possibility to make online reservations based on the availability of canoes per day or part of the day and pay for them immediately. The summer days may cause canoes to be fully rented out well in advance; by paying and reserving in advance they will be secure of their outing.
-	An API to a weather forecast to be featured on the homepage, enabling clients to pick the right date with suitable weather conditions.
-	An instructional max-3-minute video for clients to watch prior to arriving at Kanoverhuur Vathorst, enabling them to take knowledge of safe and fun paddling. The video will be hosted on Youtube or Vimeo. The purpose of the video is
    to give parents the feeling that we're taking security of their children and themselves very seriously. Following the instructions will also contribute to the fun on the water and prevent injuries.
-   An instructional video on how to pass any sluice or canoe crossing
-   We will also add a section to feature more recent reviews and rating. 
-   When feasible, a more sophisticated and better supported date-time picker in the booking form will be included. For now, we have used a simple HTML version which is only supported from Chrome 20.0, Opera 10.1 and 
    Internet Explorer 13.0, but not by Firefox or Safari. We have chosen in this version for simple HMTL input type while we have no knowledge yet of javascript. We have considered
    the use of a polyfill (https://polyfill.io/v3/) but have chosen not to use this as it might have affected other pieces of code as well.


## Technologies Used
For this application, we have used the following technologies:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com)
- Fonts have been obtained from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
- and icons have been rendered from [Fontawesome](https://www.fontawesome.com)
- A special mention on the pictures carousels on the Canoes and Routes pages, for which the code has been taken from [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp) and 
  consequently altered to fit the needs of this website. 

## Testing

This website has been made using a MacBook Pro 15inch and an iMac 27inch, and tested throughout the development process in Google Chrome 
Version 79.0.3945.130 (Official build) (64-bits). For testing, the site has been checked on Safari 13.05, Opera Version:66.0.3515.44 and Firefox 72.0.2 (64-bits) as well as 
Internet Explorer {version!} on a Windows laptop. 

Testing has been carried out using the following methods:
1. HTML code has been validated through the [W3 Consortium's HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and subsequently improved. 
2. CSS has been validated by running it in the [Jigsaw CSS validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) of the same consortium, and subsequently improved. 
3. Google Chrome's DevTools has been used to test responsiveness and check for bugs
4. The site has also been run through [Justin Avery's website](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) to check for errors and responsiveness. A screenshot of that is provided at the top of this document.
5. Peers of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development have been requested to provide their views and use their browsers for feedback.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

BUGS:
- when I changed the third column of the busines section to md-12, navigation-bar started to hide partly behind the hero-image. 
- both forms (booking.html and contact.html) provide an error page after submitting, because the form action has not been defined yet. This will be solved in the future when the website will
  be hosted at the provider.
- following a peer review, three of the four social icons showed an underline when hovered. Removed by adding text-decoration:none to those links
- Pages with large hero-images took a long time to load: all pictures have been resized to max 300kb to enable quick loading.
- following an attempt to update the canoes carousel, the carousel started to show background colors on the next/forward buttons and showing the pictures outside of the div-element. This has been solved by
  uncommenting the width/heigth and centering the background-position.
