# Kanoverhuur_Vathorst

Kanoverhuur Vathorst is a canoe rental agency in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, located in the Vathorst district. The district has gained status for its 
architectural beauty, its central and convenient location, its closeness to the Arkemheen Polder and the abundance of water. The Vathorst district is popular with families and is
highly attractive families moving from Amsterdam and Utrecht. Kanoverhuur Vathorst is the third company in the district offering recreational rental vehicles on the water, alongside
Sloepverhuur Vathorst (electric dinghys) and Lakeside SUP (stand up paddle board school and rental). Kanoverhuur Vathorst is a second activity of the latter.  

This website aims to inform inhabitants of the Vathorst district of: 
- possibilities to rent kayaks and canoes and accessories 
- possible routes and architecture to enjoy
- pricing per day/hour/canoe
- the general conditions and cancellation policy
- payment options
- packages for family outings or birthday parties
- instructions for safe and comfortable canoeing
- as well as location, parking information and opening hours.

Commercially, Kanoverhuur Vathorst aims to
- increase brand awareness
- attract more clients
- simplify booking through its reservation form
- and increase its return on investment on the canoes for the year 2020 and beyond.

This is primarily a B2C application, although companies occasionally may reach out for a company outing (B2B). For that a separate section/page is envisaged for future releases with tailor made content.
The footer will show the links to socials (not present yet).

Although being a second activity of Lakeside SUP, Kanoverhuur Vathorst will use its own name and branding and chooses to use colors that are different to the colors of Lakeside SUP.

The site targets mainly Dutch-speaking clients, but is made in English, enabling Code Institute readers to understand the content. The final live version will be in Dutch only.

## UX
 


The Vathorst district has 26,441 inhabitants (2019, source: City of Amersfoort), of which 79% is in the age bracket of 5-54 years. 26% of total inhabitants is between 5 and 19 years old. The total number
of households is 2,627, of which almost 1,000 are families with one or more children. 75% of the inhabitants are in the higher income groups. The target audience is a highly mobile savvy public.  
The city of Amersfoort has developed the Vathorst area with active use of the water in mind. Especially in the Laak area, where houses have been built with 12 hectares of available water in the canals and the
surrounding area. Kanoverhuur Vathorst is located in the Laak area and offers easy access to the canals and the surrounding nature. 

The customer will want to be able to quickly see whether: 
a) canoes are available
b) what the pricing is
c) what the location is and
d) they want a fast, simple and convenient way to book and pay ahead (for themselves or for their kids).
e) get a feel that this is a trustworthy company. From LakesideSUP clients, we have heard that a professional website helps to attract clients from outside the region and even from abroad. 

Kanoverhuur Vathorst wants to:
a) inform a broader public of its existence and thus attract more customers to increase the return on investment of the canoes
b) have an application that enables customers to book ahead online, so that manual processing of booking can be decreased as much as possible, as well as reduce the number of faults/mistakes when handling bookings by phone or through e-mails.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
-	A home page section similar to "Our canoes" offering packages for larger family outings or birthday parties, including pricing.
-   A company outing section/page for B2B clients. For that a separate section/page is envisaged for future releases with tailor made content and information form.
-	An API to Google maps will be included enabling the customer to navigate to the destination
-	A possibility to make online reservations based on the availability of canoes per day or part of the day and pay for them immediately. The summer days may cause canoes to be fully rented out well in advance; by paying and reserving in advance they will be secure of their outing.
-	An API to a weather forecast to be featured on the homepage, enabling clients to pick the right date with suitable weather conditions.
-	An instructional max-3-minute video for clients to watch prior to arriving at Kanoverhuur Vathorst, enabling them to take knowledge of safe and fun paddling. The video will be hosted on Youtube or Vimeo. The purpose of the video is
    to give parents the feeling that we're taking security of their children and themselves very seriously. Following the instructions will also contribute to the fun on the water and prevent injuries.
-   An instructional video on how to pass any sluice or canoe crossing
-   We will also add a section to feature more recent reviews and rating. 
-   When feasible, a more sophisticated and better supported date-time picker in the booking form will be included. For now, we have used a simple HTML version which is only supported from Chrome 20.0, Opera 10.1 and 
    Internet Explorer 13.0, but not by Firefox or Safari. We have chosen in this version for simple HMTL input type while we have no knowledge yet of javascript. We have considered
    the use of a polyfill (https://polyfill.io/v3/) but have chosen not to use this as it might have affected other pieces of code as well.


## Technologies Used
For this application, we have used the following technologies:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap4 (https://getbootstrap.com)
- Fonts have been obtained from Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com)
- and icons have been rendered from Fontawesome (https://www.fontawesome.com)
- JavaScript - the code snippet for the slideshows on canoes.html and routes.html have been taken from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp and then modified.

## Testing [section in progress]

[IDEAS:
- AMIRESPONSIVE
- CSS validator W3 Consortium
- HTML validator W3 Consortium

Peer review with CI students on Slack
Peer review LabelVier network (as agreed)
]

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

BUGS:
- when I changed the third column of the busines section to md-12, navigation-bar started to hide partly behind the hero-image. 
- both forms (booking.html and contact.html) provide an error page after submitting, because the form action has not been defined yet. This will be solved in the future when the website will
  be hosted at the provider.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

### Acknowledgements
Special credits for this project go to Anna Greaves, who's testimonial has convinced me to join the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development program and who was willing
to share her Github repositories with me. When it was hard to figure out why things didn't work, Anna's code was an excellent resource to look at for inspiration.
A big thanks to the Slack community hosting the fellow students, tutors and mentors for Code Institute's program; they have been great mental and technical support in getting this milestone done.
A special thanks to my mentor Narender for making the time to go through the project with me, giving me tips and hints and supporting me throughout the development.
